Cook noodles as per package instructions. Heat 2 tbsp sesame oil in a wok or kadai. Keep the flame on medium intensity and add ⅓ cup spring onion whites. Stir and then add all the veggies. Increase the flame to high and stir fry the veggies for 4 to 5 minutes on a high flame. Then add ½ tsp crushed black pepper powder and 1 tsp finely chopped celery. Add 1 tbsp soy sauce. Stir everything very well. Then add the cooked noodles. Season with salt. Stir again very well. The filling has to be dry. Switch off the flame and add the spring onion greens.
For sealing paste, mix 6 tbsp all purpose flour or corn starch and 4 to 5 tbsp water. Stir very well to make a thick paste without any lumps. Take the wrapper, apply the paste on the edges of the wrapper. Then place 1 tbsp of the veggie stuffing on one side, gently but tightly roll till the end. Seal the end part to the roll and place the roll with the sealed side downwards. Now spread some of the paste on the sides. Bring one side touching the roll and press gently, do the same with the other side. Again spread the batter on both the closed edges.
Heat oil at the deep frying temperature. gently slid on spring roll. if the oil is not hot enough, then the spring rolls absorb oil and become soggy. Once they become light golden, turn them over and fry the other side. Fry them till they are crisp and golden. Remove them with a slotted spoon. Drain on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil. Garnish with some chopped spring onion greens and serve the spring rolls hot with red chili sauce or tomato ketchup.
